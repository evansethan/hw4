While the runtimes varied, the versions with direct 2x2 determinant methods ran about twice as fast across all three programs. 

It seems as if it doesn't matter if the methods are specialized or overloaded, the runtime is still signifiantly shortened.

It also shows how creating a 2x2 simplified "base case" in addition to the existing 1x1 reduces the determinant calculation runtime, since much of higher-order determinant calculations still involve lots of 2x2 determinant calculations.
